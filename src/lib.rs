//! gpuikit
//!
//! A comprehensive UI component library for GPUI applications.
//!
//! # Quick Start
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use gpui::Application;
//! use gpuikit::init;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     Application::with_platform(gpui_platform::current_platform(false))
//!         .with_assets(gpuikit::assets())
//!         .run(|cx| {
//!             init(cx);
//!             // ... your app code
//!         });
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The platform comes from `gpui_platform`, which your app depends on
//! alongside `gpui` — gpuikit does not re-export either. `false` asks for a
//! real windowing platform rather than a headless one.
//!
//! # Feature Flags
//!
//! All features are off by default.
//!
//! - `editor` — the editor component, and the syntect-backed syntax
//!   highlighting markdown code fences use once an app calls
//!   `markdown::init_code_highlighting` (itself gated on this feature)
//! - `stitch` — closes the syntax a partially streamed markdown document leaves
//!   open (`**bold`, `[label](htt`) before parsing, so streaming text does not
//!   flicker between literal markers and styled text. Pulls in
//!   [mdstitch](https://docs.rs/mdstitch), which **requires Rust 1.95**;
//!   [`markdown::preprocessing_available`] reports which build you got
//! - `runtime_shaders` — compiles Metal shaders at runtime rather than at build
//!   time, so a macOS build needs no Xcode Metal toolchain
//! - `schema` — adds the `schemars` dependency. Nothing here derives
//!   `JsonSchema` yet, so today this only affects your dependency graph
//!
//! # Minimum Rust version
//!
//! This crate declares `rust-version = "1.85"`, which is a statement about its
//! own source — async closures, and edition 2024 — rather than a guarantee
//! about a whole build. Edition 2024 selects cargo's v3 resolver, which unlike
//! v2 does take that floor into account: when it picks a *new* version of a
//! dependency it prefers one whose own `rust-version` fits. That is a
//! preference, not a wall, and it says nothing about the versions `Cargo.lock`
//! already names — several of those declare more (cosmic-text and smol_str
//! 1.89, oo7 1.92 on Linux), so on a toolchain near 1.85 you will most likely
//! meet one of theirs first. A recent stable is the practical answer.
//!
//! The `stitch` feature raises gpuikit's own floor to **1.95**. It is the only
//! one that does.

/// No runtime code, and nothing outside a test build. One test reads

    // (the popup answers Tab with an action listener instead) and always
    // outrank `Dialog`'s Escape, which is what lets a select inside a dialog
    // close its own popup. Registering last is belt and braces for the second

    // `"<Component> > Input"` context predicate, which matches at the focused
    // field's own node and so *ties* on depth with `bind_input_keys`' plain
    // `Input` binding. gpui's `KeyBindingContextPredicate::Descendant`
    // (`gpui/src/keymap/context.rs:181`, parsed from `>` at `:361`) is what
    // makes that predicate legal, and `Keymap::bindings_for_input`
    // (`gpui/src/keymap.rs:173`) sorts candidates
    // `depth_b.cmp(depth_a).then(ix_b.cmp(ix_a))` — descending depth, then
    // descending registration index. So the later registration wins the tie,
    // and registered before `bind_input_keys` these two would compile, run,
    // and do nothing: every arrow key would move the text cursor. See
