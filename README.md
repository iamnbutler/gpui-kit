> 🚧 Pre-1.0: expect breaking changes in every release. Pin your version. 🚧

A UI toolkit for [gpui](https://www.gpui.rs) applications. Targeting a conceptual union of SwiftUI and web-style component libraries to make building modern gpui applications seamless.

## Getting started

gpuikit builds against
[gpui-unofficial](https://github.com/iamnbutler/gpui-unofficial), a crates.io
distribution of gpui — your app should depend on the same one:

```toml
[dependencies]
gpui = { package = "gpui-unofficial", version = "1.14" }
gpui_platform = { package = "gpui-platform-gpui-unofficial", version = "1.14", features = ["font-kit"] }
gpuikit = "0.9"
```

`gpui_platform` is what builds the windowing platform an `Application` runs on;
gpuikit re-exports neither it nor `gpui`, so your app names all three.

```rust
use gpui::Application;

fn main() {
    Application::with_platform(gpui_platform::current_platform(false))
        .with_assets(gpuikit::assets())
        .run(|cx| {
            gpuikit::init(cx);
            // ... your app
        });
}
```

Browse every component in the [showcase](https://nate.rip/gpuikit/), built
from this repository on every push to `main` — a component can be linked to,
as in [`#table`](https://nate.rip/gpuikit/#table). Offline, the same binary
runs natively:

```sh
cargo run --example showcase --features examples
```

More examples, and how to run them, in [examples/](examples/README.md). API
docs are at [docs.rs/gpuikit](https://docs.rs/gpuikit).

## Feature flags

All off by default:

| Flag              | What it adds                                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `editor`          | The `Editor` component, and syntect-based syntax highlighting for markdown code fences                       |
| `stitch`          | Flicker-free streaming markdown: unterminated syntax (`**bold`) is closed before parsing. Requires Rust 1.95 |
| `runtime_shaders` | Compiles Metal shaders at runtime, so macOS builds don't need the Xcode Metal toolchain                      |
| `schema`          | Adds the `schemars` dependency                                                                               |

## Web

gpuikit runs in the browser on gpui's web platform (WebGPU via wgpu). The
[hosted showcase](https://nate.rip/gpuikit/) is `examples/showcase.rs` built
for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` by [`examples/showcase-web/`](examples/showcase-web),
a [trunk](https://trunkrs.dev) harness. It needs nightly, because gpui's web
platform runs background work on web workers over a shared wasm memory and
std has to be rebuilt with atomics; `scripts/showcase-web.sh` names the
nightly and sets that up:

```sh
scripts/showcase-web.sh serve
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:8081> in a WebGPU-capable browser. Nothing in
your own app needs nightly unless it, too, is built for the web.

## Minimum Rust version

1.85, or 1.95 with the `stitch` feature. Some dependencies require newer
stables, so prefer a recent toolchain.
